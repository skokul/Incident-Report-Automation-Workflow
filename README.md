# Incident Report Automation Workflow

## Overview
This repository showcases my expertise in automating business processes, specifically focusing on incident report procedures in a business setting. Created as part of an assessment during a hiring process, this project highlights my ability to design and document workflows, acceptance criteria, and sequence diagrams for complex systems.

## Project Highlights
- **Use Case:** Automation of incident reporting where management teams document incidents, review the events, and take immediate action. This system is designed to streamline the recording, preservation, and dissemination of information to relevant teams and law enforcement as required.
- **Objective:** Demonstrate my capability to create an efficient, reliable, and scalable workflow that addresses the needs of a modern business environment.
